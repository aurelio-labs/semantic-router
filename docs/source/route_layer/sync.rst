Synchronizing with Remote Instances
===================================

Semantic router supports several *remote instances* that store our routes and
utterances, such as Pinecone or Qdrant, supported via the `PineconeIndex` and
`QdrantIndex` respectively.

Using these remote instances is optional, but it allows us to scale our
semantic router to a larger number of routes and utterances. However, we must
decide how to synchronize between our local metadata and the remote instance â€”
particularly when reinitializing a local instance that should connect to an
existing remote instance.

Semantic router supports several synchronization strategies that can be passed
to the `sync` parameter of the various `BaseIndex` objects. Those strategies
are:

* `error`: Raise an error if local and remote are not synchronized.
* `remote`: Take remote as the source of truth and update local to align.
* `local`: Take local as the source of truth and update remote to align.
* `merge-force-remote`: Merge both local and remote taking only remote routes
  utterances when a route with same route name is present both locally and
  remotely.
* `merge-force-local`: Merge both local and remote taking only local routes
  utterances when a route with same route name is present both locally and
  remotely.
* `merge`: Merge both local and remote, merging also local and remote utterances
  when a route with same route name is present both locally and remotely.

You can try this yourself by running the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from semantic_router import Route
    from semantic_router.encoders import OpenAIEncoder
    from semantic_router.index.pinecone import PineconeIndex
    from semantic_router.layer import RouteLayer


    politics = Route(
        name="politics",
        utterances=[
            "isn't politics the best thing ever",
            "why don't you tell me about your political opinions",
            "don't you just love the president",
        ],
    )

    chitchat = Route(
        name="chitchat",
        utterances=[
            "how's the weather today?",
            "how are things going?",
        ],
    )

    routes = [politics, chitchat]

    encoder = OpenAIEncoder(openai_api_key=openai_api_key)

    pc_index = PineconeIndex(
        api_key=pinecone_api_key,
        region="us-east-1",
        index_name="sync-example",
        sync="local",  # here we specify the synchronization strategy
    )

    rl = RouteLayer(encoder=encoder, routes=routes, index=pc_index)

When initializing the `PineconeIndex` object, we can specify the `sync` parameter.
