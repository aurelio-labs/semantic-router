# Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have demon- strated remarkable potential in handling mul- tilingual machine translation (MMT). In this paper, we systematically investigate the advan- tages and challenges of LLMs for MMT by an- swering two questions: 1) How well do LLMs perform in translating massive languages? 2) Which factors affect LLMsâ performance in translation? We thoroughly evaluate eight pop- ular LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4. Our empirical results show that translation ca- pabilities of LLMs are continually improving. GPT-4 has beat the strong supervised baseline NLLB in 40.91% of translation directions but still faces a large gap towards the commercial translation system, especially on low-resource languages. Through further analysis, we dis- cover that LLMs exhibit new working patterns when used for MMT. First, instruction seman- tics can surprisingly be ignored when given in-context exemplars. Second, cross-lingual ex- emplars can provide better task guidance for low-resource translation than exemplars in the same language pairs. Third, LLM can acquire translation ability in a resource-efficient way and generate moderate translation even on zero- resource languages 1.

models are not particularly optimized on multilin- gual data.
However, the multilingual translation ability of LLMs remains under-explored. MMT is a challeng- ing task that involves translating text among dif- ferent languages and requires semantic alignment between languages (Fan et al., 2021; Costa-jussÃ  et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023). It is also unclear that how LLM acquires translation ability and which factors affect LLMâs translation ability.
# Introduction
With the increasing scale of parameters and training corpus, large language models (LLMs) have gained a universal ability to handle a variety of tasks via in-context learning (ICL, Brown et al. 2020), which allows language models to perform tasks with a few given exemplars and human-written instructions as context. One particular area where LLMs have shown outstanding potential is machine translation (MT). Previous studies have shown the surprising performance of LLMs on high-resource bilingual translation, such as English-German translation (Vi- lar et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), even if these

In this paper, we follow ICL paradigm and focus on studying LLMs in multilingual machine trans- lation by answering two questions: 1) How LLMs perform MMT over massive languages? 2) Which factors affect the performance of LLMs?
For the first question, we evaluate several pop- ular LLMs: English-centric LLMs, including OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023) and multilingual LLMs, including XGLM (Lin et al., 2022), BLOOMZ (Scao et al., 2022), Chat- GPT (OpenAI, 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), and consider 102 languages, 606 translation direc-
tions (202 English-centric directions, 202 French- centric directions and 202 Chinese-centric direc- tions). Results show that the multilingual transla- tion capabilities of LLMs are continually improv- ing and GPT-4 reaches new performance height. Compared with the widely-used supervised MMT system NLLB (Costa-jussÃ  et al., 2022), GPT-4 achieves higher performance on 40.91% English- centric translation directions. But compared with the commercial translation system (Google Trans- lator), LLMs still have a long way to go, partic- ularly when it comes to low-resource languages. French-centric and Chinese-centric translation are more challenging for GPT-4 than English-centric translation, which further indicates its unbalanced capability across languages.
For the second question, we find some new work- ing patterns. First, LLMs are able to perform trans- lation even with unreasonable instructions if in- context learning exemplars are given. However, if given mismatched translation pairs as in-context exemplars, LLMs fail to translate, which is similar to observations from concurrent studies (Wei et al., 2023). This shows the importance of exemplars in ICL for machine translation. Second, we find that cross-lingual translation pairs can be surprisingly good exemplars for low-resource translation, even better than exemplars in the same language. Third, we discover that LLM can acquire translation abil- ity in a resource-efficient way and generate moder- ate translation even on zero-resource languages.
The main contribution of this paper can be sum- marized below:
â¢ We benchmark popular LLMs on MMT in 102 languages and 606 translation directions, covering English-centric, French-centric and Chinese-centric translation.
â¢ We systematically compare the results of LLMs and three strong supervised base- lines (M2M-100, NLLB, Google Translator) and reveal the gap between two translation paradigms.
â¢ We find some new ICL working patterns of LLMs for MMT and discuss corresponding advantages and challenges.
# 2 Background
# 2.1 Large Language Models
Language modeling is a long-standing task in nat- ural language processing (Bengio et al., 2000;
Mikolov et al., 2010; Khandelwal et al., 2020), which is a task to predict the probability of the next token. Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) basically is the backbone of existing LLMs.
LLMs show great potential as a universal multi- task learner. Recently, Radford et al. (2019) find that a casual decoder-only language model can be a multi-task learner with merely unsupervised train- ing corpus. Later, Kaplan et al. (2020) reveal the scaling law of LLM, indicating that when the scale of neural parameters and training data keeps in- creasing, LLM can be further strengthened. Wei et al. (2022b) show that scaling the language model also brings astonishing emergent abilities, e.g., in- context learning, which is only present in large models. Consequently, more and more efforts have been put into scaling-up language models (Brown et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022; Vilar et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2023). Among them, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and ChatGPT (Ope- nAI, 2022) are the most representative systems, which shows impressive results in various NLP tasks.
# 2.2 Emergent Ability: In-context Learning
In-context learning is one of the well-known emer- gent abilities (Brown et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2022), which enables LLM to learn target tasks according to the prompt without updating any pa- rameters.
Specifically, the prompt is made up of in-context exemplars {(Xi, Yi)}k i=1 and in-context template T . Exemplars are often picked from supervised data, where Yi is the ground truth corresponding to the input sentence Xi. Template T is usually a human-written instruction related to the target task. Wrapping exemplars with the template and concate- nating them together produce the final prompt:
P = T (X1, Y1) â T (X2, Y2) â Â· Â· Â· â T (Xk, Yk)
where â denotes the concatenation symbol, e.g., whitespace, line-break. During inference, LLM is able to generate the corresponding output Y of the test sample X under the guidance of the prompt:
arg max Y p(P â T (X , Y)) (1)
For label prediction tasks, the prediction Y can be obtained in one-step generation. For sequence generation tasks, e.g., machine translation, the pre- diction Y can be obtained through sampling strate- gies like greedy search and beam search.

# 3 Experiment Setup
Dataset We benchmark multilingual translation on FLORES-101 (Goyal et al., 2022) dataset2, which enables an assessment of model quality on a wide range of languages.
Supervised baselines We report the performance of the supervised model M2M-100-12B (Fan et al., 2021) and NLLB-1.3B (Costa-jussÃ  et al., 2022) (distillation version), which are widely-used many- to-many MMT models. We also report the per- formance of the powerful commercial translation system, Google Translator4.
LLMs We evaluate translation performance of eight popular LLMs: XGLM-7.5B (Lin et al., 2022), OPT-175B (Zhang et al., 2022), BLOOMZ- 7.1B (Scao et al., 2022), Falcon-7B (Almazrouei et al., 2023), LLaMA2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023), LLaMA2-7B-chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Chat- GPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023).
Metric Following Goyal et al. (2022), we use SentencePiece BLEU5 (spBLEU) as evaluation metric, which enables an evaluation of all lan- guages. In addition, we also consider emerg- ing metrics, COMET6 (Rei et al., 2020) and SEScore7 (Xu et al., 2022b), which have been shown to correlate well with human judgements.
ICL strategy For each model, we report its trans- lation performance with eight randomly-picked translation pairs from the corresponding develop- ment set as in-context exemplars and â<X>=<Y>â as in-context template. â<X>â and â<Y>â are the placeholder for the source and target sentence. We use line-break as the concatenation symbol. Ac- cording to our experiment analysis, this ICL strat- egy serves as a simple but strong recipe. All imple- mentation is based on OpenICL3 (Wu et al., 2023).
# 4 Benchmarking LLMs for Massively Multilingual Machine Translation

family. Monolingual pre-trained LLMs present im- pressive multilingual translation ability, indicating the possibility of aligning multiple languages even with unsupervised data (Garcia et al., 2023). More encouragingly, the multilingual translation capa- bilities of LLMs are continually improving. The most recent LLMs are reaching new performance heights; for example, LLaMA2-7B outperforms previously released open-source LLMs, and GPT- 4 surpasses ChatGPT. Overall, GPT-4 is the best translator among evaluated LLMs and it achieves the highest average BLEU and COMET score on most directions.

Table 2: Translation performance (BLEU) of GPT-4 on English-centric, French-centric and Chinese-centric translation.
LLMâs capability is unbalanced across lan- guages In Table 1, we observe a similar trend for all evaluated LLMs: they perform better at translating into English than translating into non- English. LLMâs capability on non-English lan- guages is also unbalanced. For languages that are similar to English, e.g, Indo-European-Germanic languages, LLMs achieve impressive results. For languages that are dissimilar to English, e.g., Sino- Tibetan languages, LLMs often produce less decent results.
Table 2 presents another clue, where we evaluate GPT-4 on French-centric and Chinese-centric trans- lation. Compared to English-centric translation, GPT-4 faces greater challenge when it comes to non-English-centric translation, which again indi- cates LLMâs unbalanced translation ability across languages.
LLMs still lag behind the strong supervised baseline, especially on low-resource languages Figure 2 shows the translation performance of the supervised systems and GPT-4 on each lan- guage. In 40.91% translation directions, GPT-4 has achieved higher BLEU scores than NLLB, indi- cating the promising future of this new translation paradigm. But on long-tail low-resource languages, GPT-4 still lags behind NLLB, let alone Google Translator.

# 5 Analyzing Factors That Influence LLMâs Translation Performance
Figure 4: Translation performance of different models on FLORES-101 test set and our annotated no-leakage evaluation set NEWS2023.
Data leakage issue should be considered before evaluating LLMs on public datasets. We do not include BLOOMZâs performance on FLORES- 101 in our report because BLOOMZ is instruction- tuned with XP3 dataset (Scao et al., 2022), which includes FLORES-200 dataset. Thus BLOOMZ may have been exposed to test cases from FLORES- 101 during training. If so, the evaluation results can not precisely reflect its translation ability (Elan- govan et al., 2021).
To illustrate this concern, we take 1000 English sentences from the most recent news spanning August 2023 to October 20239, and ask human experts to translate them into Chinese and con- struct a bilingual no-leakage evaluation set, named NEWS2023.

To better understand how LLM acquires transla- tion ability and which factors have influence on its performance, we conduct in-depth analysis. For analysis, we choose XGLM-7.5B as an example10. Note that, when studying a certain factor, we keep the remaining factors unchanged.
# 5.1 Findings on Pre-training Corpus Size
LLM can acquire translation ability in a resource-efficient way. As XGLM authors re- port data distribution of their pre-training corpus, we can investigate the relationship between trans- lation performance and corpus size (Figure 3). We find that for low-resource languages, e.g., Catalan (cat) and Swahili (swh), XGLM can generate mod- erate translation, showing that LLM can build bilin- gual mapping between non-English and English
10We choose XGLM for three reasons: (1) XGLM has a multilingual focus and covers many languages, which can be seen as a representative of multilingual LLM. (2) XGLM-7.5B is an open-source medium-sized LLM. It is more affordable to run experiments with it than large-sized LLM or close- source LLM. (3) The composition of the XGLMâs pre-training corpus is clear, allowing us to analyze the relationship between translation ability and corpus size.

with a few non-English monolingual resources (less than 1% of English resources). Even on unseen languages, e.g., Occitan (oci) and Asturian (ast), XGLM can translate through ICL. These observa- tions indicate a potential advantage of the novel translation paradigm: LLM can learn to translate in a resource-efficient way.
# 5.2 Findings on In-context Template
The good performance of LLMs relies on carefully-designed template The initial step of applying in-context learning for translation is de- termining the template. We find that the trans- lation performance varies greatly with different templates (Table 3), where the largest gap in the average performance is up to 16 BLEU. The best template for each direction is also different. Among these templates, â<X>=<Y>â achieves the highest average BLEU score. â[SRC]: <X> 
 [TGT]: <Y>â achieves the lowest score, al- though it is a commonly-used template for prompt- ing other LLMs, e.g., PaLM (Vilar et al., 2022), GLM (Zhang et al., 2023). Such phenomena indi- cate that the template plays a vital role in ICL and it may be challenging to design a universally op- timal template for different LLMs and translation directions.
Even unreasonable template can instruct LLM to generate decent translation A common intu- ition of ICL is that the template instructs LLMs to do the target task (Brown et al., 2020), e.g., the template â<X> can be translated to <Y>â in- structs the LLM to perform translation task. How-

ever, we find that wrapping translation exemplars with task-unrelated template can also serve as an effective prompt. For example, the template like â<X> can be summarized as <Y>â can also in- struct LLM to generate translation, rather than guid- ing it to generate summarization. Given the fact that these unreasonable template are also effective, the community may not fully understand the role of in-context-template.
# 5.3 Findings on In-context Exemplar
Cross-lingual exemplars help for certain trans- lation directions Translation direction of the ex- emplar is a unique factor in machine translation. We find that using cross-lingual exemplars does not always causes worse performance and show two cases in Figure 5. When using cross-lingual exem- plars for German-English translation, the transla- tion performance degenerates. But when using cross-lingual exemplars for low-resource Chinese-

English translation (illustrated in Appendix D), XGLMâs translation performance usually improves significantly, even when both source and target language is changed. This phenomenon indicates the potential usage of cross-lingual exemplars in a broader range of tasks (Lin et al., 2022), and we will explore more about this in the future.

namely Random11, BM2512, TopK13 and Oracle14. Effects of selecting varying number of in-context exemplars with different approaches are shown in Figure 6. The general trend in all dataset is simi- lar. As the number of examples grows from 1 to 8, the BLEU score increases rapidly. Afterwards, the translation performance plateaus regardless of se- lection strategy. When more exemplars are added, e.g., 32 exemplars, the BLEU score usually starts to decline, shows an opposite phenomenon against the observation in natural language understanding tasks (Li et al., 2023).
Compared to semantically-related exemplars, randomly-picked exemplars gives comparable translation performance. Even the performance of oracle selection is on par with random selection. Based on these observations, we suggest that trans- lation exemplars can teach LLM to translate but
Semantically-related exemplars does not brings more benefits than randomly-picked exemplars In this paper, we use development set for exemplar selection, which has been found to be a high-quality candidate pool (Vilar et al., 2022), and we com- pare four ways of selecting in-context exemplars,
11Random: picking exemplars on a random basis. 12BM25: selecting exemplars whose source sentences are similar to the test caseâs source sentence according to BM25. 13TopK: selecting exemplars whose source sentences are similar to the test caseâs source sentence according to the similarity of sentence embedding.
14Oracle: selecting exemplars whose target sentences are similar to the test caseâs according to sentence embedding, which can be seen as the upper bound of selection strategy.
LLM may struggle to acquire helpful translation knowledge from semantically-related exemplars.
Exemplars teach LLM the core feature of trans- lation task To better understand how ICL exem- plars influence LLM to understand the translation task, we observe LLMâs translation behaviour un- der abnormal in-context exemplars (Table 4).
We can see that LLM completely fails when mismatched translation is used as exemplars, indi- cating that LLM needs to learn from the context to keep source and target sentence semantically con- sistent. Word-level15 and document-level16 transla- tion exemplar degenerates LLMâs translation per- formance, which demonstrates that the translation granularity of exemplar matters as well. Another in- teresting phenomenon is that LLM performs worse when duplicated translation is used as the exem- plar, indicating that keeping in-context exemplars diverse is also important. In general, these compar- ison results show that LLM learns the core feature of translation task through in-context learning.
The exemplar in the tail of the prompt has more impact on the LLMâs behaviour During our analysis, we find that reversing the translation direc- tion of exemplars will cause LLM to fail. Based on this observation, we conduct experiments to investi- gate the importance of different parts of the prompt (Table 5). We find that reversing exemplars in the tail of the prompt consistently produced worse re- sults compared to reversing exemplars in the head, which suggests that exemplars in the tail of the prompt have larger influence on LLMâs behavior.

In-context learning for machine translation Using LLMs for multilingual machine translation is attracting more and more attention. Lin et al. (2022) evaluate GPT-3 and XGLM-7.5B on 182 directions. Bawden and Yvon (2023) evaluates BLOOM on 30 directions. Bang et al. (2023), Jiao et al. (2023) and Hendy et al. (2023) evaluate ChatGPT on 6 to 18 directions. In this paper, we thoroughly evalu- ate multilingual translation performance of popular LLMs on 102 languages and 606 directions and compare them with state-of-the-art translation en- gines, such as NLLB and Google Translate, which provides a more comprehensive benchmark result

and highlights the challenges involved in optimiz- ing this emerging translation paradigm.
To find better ICL recipe for machine transla- tion, many efforts have been put into designing exemplars selection strategy (Agrawal et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Moslem et al., 2023). Similar to the findings of Zhang et al. (2023), we find that random selection is a simple but effective strategy. We also find that even oracle selection can not re- sult in consistently better performance. Wei et al. (2022a) shows few-shot exemplars improve trans- lation performance. But we further demonstrate the dynamic variations of translation performance with the number of in-context exemplars and the usage of cross-lingual exemplars. Besides, Vilar et al. (2022) find that using a high-quality pool, e.g., development set, for ICL example selection is better and Zhang et al. (2023) analyze why the quality of translation exemplars matters. In this paper, we reveal how in-context exemplars teach LLM to translate by analyzing LLMâs behaviour under different kinds of exemplars.
Multilingual machine translation Developing a bilingual translation system for each direction be- comes impossible when the number of supporting languages increases. Therefore, multilingual ma- chine translation is proposed (Johnson et al., 2017). But how to build a high-quality yet efficient MMT system remains an on-going challenge (Costa-jussÃ  et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023; Guerreiro et al., 2023). In this paper, we focus on LLM and reveal its potential in MMT.
# 7 Conclusion
In this paper, we evaluate the multilingual transla- tion ability of popular LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, on 102 languages and 606 directions, which presents the advantages and challenges of LLMs for MMT. We find that translation capabili- ties of LLMs are continually improving and GPT- 4 reaches new performance height. But even for GPT-4, it still face challenge on low-resource lan- guages. In our analysis, we find that LLMs ex- hibit new working patterns when used for MMT. For example, instruction semantics can be ignored during in-context learning and cross-lingual exem- plars can provide better task instruction for low- resource translation. More importantly, we find that LLM can acquire translation ability in a resource- efficient way, which indicates the promising future of LLM in multilingual machine translation.

# A Evaluating LLMâs translation performance with SEScore
Table 6 presents average SEScore of LLMs on different language families. Currently, SEScore mainly supports evaluating English translation. Thus we evaluate LLMâs performance on trans- lating other languages to English.
# B Detailed Results on Each Language
We report detailed results of our evaluated mod- els in Table 7 (BLEU), Table 8 (COMET), Table 9 (SEScore) and Figure 8. One thing that needs to be mentioned is that BLEU supports all transla- tion directions, whereas COMET and SEScore only support a subset of these translation directions.
# C Lists of Language
We evaluate 102 languages in this paper. Table 10 lists the name, ISO code and language family of these languages.
# D Cross-lingual Exemplars
In Figure 5, we show an example of using cross- lingual in-context exemplars (Russian-English ex-
emplars for Chinese-English translation).
